# Mindustry: A Game Design and Codebase Analysis

This project analyzes the success and longevity of Mindustry, an open-source hybrid tower-defense and factory-building game created by Anuke during a 2017 Game Jam. 

We'll explore the key factors behind its thriving community and robust codebase, assessing stakeholder dynamics, code complexity, and maintainability metrics. 

Our goal is to provide insights and propose improvements, including a contributor tutorial, to support the continued growth of this popular open-source project.
